# Active-Directory-and-Splunk-Project-

![Final Active Directory Splunk PDF ](https://github.com/mquijivix/Active-Directory-and-Splunk-Project-/assets/173574799/44a5553c-365d-4628-a8b1-640b99180cb9)



## Overview 

In this project, I built a comprehensive home lab environment featuring Active Directory, Windows Server, Windows 10, Kali Linux, and Splunk. The setup is designed to benefit both blue team (defensive) and red team (offensive) cybersecurity practices.






## Project Components 

Active Directory Environment

Splunk Instance for Telemetry Ingestion

Kali Linux for Brute Force Attacks

Atomic Red Team for Simulated Attacks


## Project Goals 

Understand Active Directory administration and domain functionality.

Learn how to set up and configure Splunk to ingest events from Windows Server and a target Windows machine.

Perform and analyze brute force attacks using Kali Linux.

Generate and analyze telemetry data using Splunk.









## Requirements 
Operating Systems and Tools:
Windows Server 2022
Windows 10
Kali Linux
Splunk (installed on Ubuntu Server)
Virtualization:
VirtualBox for running virtual machines



## Installation and Setup 

**Part 1: Setting Up Virtual Machines**

Download and Install VirtualBox

Install Windows Server 2022

Install Windows 10

Install Kali Linux

Install Splunk on Ubuntu Server



**Part 2: Configuring Active Directory**

Promote Windows Server to a Domain Controller

Create New Domain Users

Join Target Windows PC to the Domain



**Part 3: Installing and Configuring Sysmon and Splunk**

Install Sysmon for Logging Purposes

Configure Splunk to Ingest Telemetry Data



**Part 4: Performing Brute Force Attacks with Kali Linux**

Launch Brute Force Attack Against Domain Users

Analyze Telemetry Generated by Splunk




**Part 5: Simulating Attacks with Atomic Red Team**

Install Atomic Red Team

Run Tests and Analyze Generated Telemetry




## Hands-On Practice 

Blue Team Activities:
Detect and create alerts using telemetry from the server or target machine.
Learn to use Splunk for creating queries, alerts, dashboards, and reports.
Red Team Activities:
Launch attacks using Kali Linux towards the Active Directory environment.
Understand how these attacks work and how to detect them.


## Conclusion 
By the end of this project, I had a fully functioning home lab environment where I could practice and enhance my cybersecurity skills. This project aims to boost confidence and technical abilities in a hands-on, practical setting.
